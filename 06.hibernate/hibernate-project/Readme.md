**Project Name: hibernate-project**

**Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT**

A simple JPA & JDBC project that makes insertion, update, deletion, and selection queries on Oracle Databse Table.

#Instructions for the Project

**External JARS** 

 + Used **Oracle JDBC Driver 10.2.0.4** for Database Connection 
 + Used **Hibernate Core 5.2.1.Final** for making the software development independent of the database.

We've configured the information about the database, such as _driver class_, _url_, _username_, and _password_. You can change these configurations by **persistence.xml** file under the resources directory.
